    <p>Say Anything was one of the first bands I saw live in concert. I already knew some of their music, but after that performance, that locked me in as a life long fan. I began to explore all their music. Did I listen to them while coding this... yes...
        Yes I did. But for good reason as you will soon see below.</p>
